# Vercel:
I first run the command `npm i -g vercel` to gloablly install `vercel`, then I just typed vercel in terminal and just selected appropriate option.
# Netifly:
Visited netifly website, then under _add new site_ selected **Github** and used this repo, after few minutes the projecct was deployed.
